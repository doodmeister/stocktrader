    ### How to Write Good Pattern Explanations
    
    When updating pattern implementations in `patterns.py`, add detailed docstrings to explain:
    
    1. **What the pattern looks like**
    2. **Market psychology behind the pattern**
    3. **Mathematical conditions** that define the pattern
    4. **Plain English explanation** of what it indicates
    5. **Trading implications** (bullish/bearish signals)
    
    Example format:
    ```python
    def is_doji(self, candle):
        """
        Identifies a Doji candlestick pattern.
        
        A Doji forms when the opening and closing prices are virtually equal.
        It represents market indecision where bulls and bears reached equilibrium.
        
        Mathematical condition:
        - |close - open| <= (high - low) * 0.05
        
        In plain terms: The body of the candle is very small (less than 5% of the total range),
        while the wicks can be of any length.
        
        Trading implication: Potential reversal signal, especially at support/resistance levels.
