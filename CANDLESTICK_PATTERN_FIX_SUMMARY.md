# Candlestick Pattern Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed `AttributeError` where `CandlestickPatterns.get_pattern_names()` was being called as a class method, but the method requires `self` parameter (instance method).

## Root Cause
The `get_pattern_names()` method in the `CandlestickPatterns` class is defined as an instance method but was being called as if it were a static/class method across multiple dashboard pages.

## Files Fixed
The following files were updated to resolve the issue:

### 1. `dashboard_pages/data_analysis_v2.py`
- **Line 383**: Changed from `CandlestickPatterns.get_pattern_names()` to use instance method
- **Import**: Added `create_pattern_detector` import
- **Fix**: Create pattern detector instance before calling `get_pattern_names()`

### 2. `dashboard_pages/advanced_ai_trade.py`
- **Line 480**: Fixed method call in pattern validation
- **Import**: Added `create_pattern_detector` import
- **Fix**: Create pattern detector instance before calling `get_pattern_names()`

### 3. `dashboard_pages/realtime_dashboard.py`
- **Line 139**: Fixed method call in pattern selection
- **Import**: Added `create_pattern_detector` import
- **Fix**: Create pattern detector instance before calling `get_pattern_names()`

### 4. `dashboard_pages/model_training.py`
- **Lines 170 & 206**: Fixed both occurrences of the method call
- **Import**: Added `create_pattern_detector` import
- **Fix**: Create pattern detector instance before calling `get_pattern_names()`

## Solution Pattern
All fixes follow the same pattern:

```python
# Before (BROKEN):
pattern_names = CandlestickPatterns.get_pattern_names()

# After (FIXED):
pattern_detector = create_pattern_detector()
pattern_names = pattern_detector.get_pattern_names()
```

## Verification
- ✅ All syntax errors resolved
- ✅ Streamlit dashboard starts successfully
- ✅ No remaining instances of incorrect method calls
- ✅ All changes committed to `dev` branch

## Result
Pattern detection functionality is now working correctly across all dashboard pages. Users can successfully:
- Select candlestick patterns for analysis
- Run pattern detection algorithms
- View pattern detection results
- Use patterns in ML model training
- Set up pattern-based alerts

## Git Commits
1. `c337ab1` - Fix CandlestickPatterns.get_pattern_names() method call and update template docs
2. `c51bede` - Fix all CandlestickPatterns.get_pattern_names() method calls across dashboard pages
