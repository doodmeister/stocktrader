E*Trade Candlestick Bot Enhancement Roadmap

Below is a comprehensive plan to implement the 10 improvement areas. Each section outlines:

Objective: what we want to achieve

Deliverables: files or modules to create/update

Implementation notes: key libraries or patterns

1. Caching & Performance

Objective: Minimize redundant API calls and speed up UI refresh.

Deliverables:

Wrap get_candles() in @st.cache_data

Add asynchronous fetching for multiple symbols (asyncio + aiohttp)

Implementation notes:

Use async def fetch_all() to gather candlesticks concurrently

Cache parameters: interval, days, symbol

2. Backtesting Framework

Objective: Paper-trade strategies on historical data.

Deliverables:

backtester.py module with:

Backtest class: load history, simulate signals, track equity

Metrics: Sharpe, win rate, max drawdown

Streamlit “Backtest” tab

Implementation notes:

Use pandas for vectorized simulation

Provide CSV export of results

3. Risk / Money Management

Objective: Add position sizing, stops, take-profits.

Deliverables:

risk_manager.py with:

position_size(account_value, risk_pct, stop_loss_atr)

stop_order() helper

UI controls for risk parameters

Implementation notes:

ATR-based stops (use ta library)

Enforce per-trade max % of portfolio

4. Expanded Feature Set & Indicators

Objective: Overlay technical indicators and allow toggling.

Deliverables:

indicators.py: wrappers around pandas-ta or ta-lib for RSI, MACD, BBands

Streamlit checkboxes to show/hide

Plot overlays on Plotly chart

Implementation notes:

Leverage plotly.graph_objs.Scatter traces

Cache indicator calculations

5. Model Lifecycle Improvements

Objective: Persist and version ML models.

Deliverables:

Save model at models/pattern_nn_v1.pth

model_manager.py for load/save

UI: toggle between “Train” vs. “Load”

Implementation notes:

Use torch.save / torch.load

Record metadata (timestamp, training params)

6. Annotation & Insights

Objective: Annotate charts and explain patterns.

Deliverables:

On-chart annotations marking pattern bars (Plotly add_trace(go.Scatter(..., text=…)))

Hover tooltips describing why flagged

Implementation notes:

Pass a text array matching timestamps

7. User Management & Security

Objective: Restrict real-trading actions.

Deliverables:

Simple login page (Streamlit secrets or OAuth)

Role-based access: view-only vs. trade-enabled

Implementation notes:

Use st_authenticator library

Store credentials in secrets.toml

8. Alerting & Notifications

Objective: Push notifications on events.

Deliverables:

notifier.py supporting email (SMTP), SMS (Twilio), Slack

UI: subscription panel per symbol/pattern

Implementation notes:

Use background thread or scheduler (APScheduler)

9. Testing & CI/CD

Objective: Ensure correctness and reproducibility.

Deliverables:

tests/ folder with pytest tests for:

Pattern functions

Backtester metrics

ML pipeline shapes

Dockerfile for containerized app

GitHub Actions workflow for lint/test/deploy

Implementation notes:

Use flake8 and black

Publish Docker image to GHCR

10. UX Enhancements

Objective: Organize UI into logical sections.

Deliverables:

Use st.tabs or multi-page to separate:

Live Dashboard

Backtester

Model Training

Settings

Add sidebar summary: portfolio P/L, open orders

Implementation notes:

Leverage Streamlit’s page config in pages/ dir

Store shared state in st.session_state

Next Steps

Review roadmap and confirm priorities or ordering.

Scaffold project directories and modules.

Implement caching & async fetch as the first deliverable.

Proceed down the list iteratively, with tests at each step.
