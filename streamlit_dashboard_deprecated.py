StockTrader Dashboard - Legacy Entry Point

This file has been refactored and modularized for better maintainability.
Please use main.py as the new entry point for the dashboard.

The dashboard has been split into focused modules:
- main.py: Entry point with Streamlit configuration
- core/dashboard_controller.py: Main orchestration logic
- core/page_loader.py: Page discovery and management
- core/health_checks.py: System health monitoring

Legacy entry point - redirects to new modular structure.

    ### ðŸš€ New Modular Structure
    
    The dashboard has been refactored into focused modules for better maintainability:
    
    - **`main.py`** - New entry point with Streamlit configuration
    - **`core/dashboard_controller.py`** - Main orchestration and UI logic  
    - **`core/page_loader.py`** - Page discovery and management
    - **`core/health_checks.py`** - System health monitoring
    
    ### âœ¨ Benefits
    
    - **Better Organization**: Code is now split into logical modules
    - **Easier Maintenance**: Each module has a single responsibility
    - **Improved Testing**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test
    - **Better Performance**: Optimized loading and caching

        ### Migration Benefits
        - **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a focused responsibility
        - **Reusability**: Modules can be imported and used independently
        - **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
        - **Testing**: Individual components can be unit tested
        - **Performance**: Better caching and optimized loading
